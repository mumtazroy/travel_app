<h1>Welcome to my Travel Site</h1>
<p>This is my very awesome travel site.</p>

The <%= @homeland %> is my home country.

And I would like to travel to:
<ul>
  <% @countries.each do |country| %>
    <li><%= country %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>

<% @travel_pics.each do |pic| %>
<%= image_tag pic, class: "img-responsive", height: 300, width: 400 %>


<% end %>
